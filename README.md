# PasswordGUI
This is a fairly simple project that demonstrates how easily a four-digit numeric password can be cracked using brute force tactics. The four-digit numeric password was the most common type of password on apple products until IOS 8. With a four-digit numeric passcode, you have 10 possible digits for each of the four positions. This gives you a total of ten-thousand total possible combinations, which can be cracked in a few seconds by most computers. For this reason, companies such as Apple don't allow unlimited password attempts to occur because it becomes passwords lose their security benefits when it is possible to use brute force on them.
